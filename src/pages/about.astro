      <h1>About Payroll for Crews</h1>

      <p>
        Payroll for Crews is a small, opinionated site for owners and managers who run people on
        jobsites, not in cubicles. It exists to help you pick a boring, reliable mix of payroll,
        time tracking, and basic HR tools that works every pay period.
      </p>

      <h2>Who this is for</h2>
      <p>
        This site is written for small crews, usually somewhere between five and fifty hourly
        workers. That can be construction, trades, landscaping, cleaning, or field service work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are the person who signs checks, deals with bids, answers crew questions, and tries
        to keep the wheels on, you are the audience.
      </p>

      <h2>What you can expect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Straight talk in plain language, not payroll jargon.</li>
        <li>Concrete examples from crew life, not enterprise case studies.</li>
        <li>Checklists and step by step sequences you can actually follow.</li>
        <li>Guides that admit tradeoffs instead of pretending there is one perfect tool.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You will not see generic top ten listicle content here. Each article is meant to help you
        solve one specific problem like switching payroll mid year, mixing W2 and 1099 workers, or
        getting off paper timesheets.
      </p>

      <h2>How tools and affiliate links work</h2>
      <p>
        Some guides include links to tools like TimeCamp, Connecteam, WebHR, Lano, or Adam by Tyms.
        In some cases these are affiliate links. That means if you sign up and stay as a paying
        customer, this site may earn a commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not change your price. It does help justify the time spent writing deeper guides
        instead of quick hit content.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a tool stops being a good fit for small crew based businesses, the plan is simple. The
        recommendation will be updated or removed. The goal is long term trust, not short term
        clicks.
      </p>

      <h2>Where to start</h2>
      <p>
        If you are new here, start with the main setup guide, then pick the problem that feels most
        painful right now.

        time tracking with less stress and fewer surprises on payday.
