      <h1>Payroll for Crews</h1>
      <p>
        This is for owners and managers who run crews on jobsites, not employees in cubicles.
        If you have 5 to 50 hourly people in construction, trades, landscaping, cleaning, or
        other field work, you are in the right place.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal here is simple. Help you pick a payroll and time tracking setup that works
        every pay period, without turning your life into spreadsheets and support calls.
      </p>

      <h2>What you will actually get</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain language guides to payroll and time tracking for crews</li>
        <li>Concrete examples for mixed W2 and 1099 teams on multiple jobsites</li>
        <li>Checklists and how tos you can hand to a foreman or office person</li>
      </ul>

        Some links on this site are referral links. If you sign up through them, the software
        company may pay a fee. I do not sell software or run payroll for clients. If I would
        not suggest a tool to a small crew I cared about, it does not go on the list.
