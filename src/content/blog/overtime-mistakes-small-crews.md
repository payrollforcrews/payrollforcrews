Overtime can turn a profitable job into a headache fast. Maybe your foreman forgets to track drive time or your crew clocks extra hours that don’t get recorded right. When you’re running a small crew, these mistakes add up and hit your bottom line hard. This post cuts to the chase on the most common overtime pitfalls for small construction companies and shows you how to fix them with clear crew rules and simple tracking habits.

## Why Overtime Rules Matter for Small Construction Crews

You’re probably already familiar with the basics: overtime kicks in after 40 hours a week in most states, sometimes daily after 8 or 12 hours, and it can vary if you’re dealing with union rules or multiple states. The problem isn’t the law itself, it’s how easy it is to miscalculate or miss overtime hours when your crew is on the move, working different jobs, or clocking in and out on paper.

For example, a 12-person roofing crew might start early, take breaks at different times, and drive between sites. If your foreman just eyeballs hours or writes times on a whiteboard at the end of the day, you’re almost guaranteed to miss overtime or pay it incorrectly. That’s lost money or worse, a compliance risk.

## Common Overtime Mistakes and How They Play Out on the Jobsite

### 1. Not Tracking All Compensable Time (Drive Time, Setup, Cleanup)

Your crew’s clocked hours might show 8 hours, but if you’re not counting drive time between jobs or time spent setting up and cleaning tools, you’re underpaying overtime. For example, a landscaping crew working two small sites in a day might spend an hour driving and 30 minutes setting up. That time counts as hours worked under most overtime rules.

**Fix:** Make foremen responsible for logging all compensable time, including drive and setup. Use a simple checklist or time tracking app crew members can update on their phones. This avoids guessing or missing chunks of paid time.

### 2. Mixing Up Overtime Thresholds for Different Jobs or Locations

If your crew works on multiple jobs or crosses state lines, overtime rules can differ. A concrete crew working 45 hours in State A might owe overtime, but if they cross into State B with daily overtime rules, the calculation changes.

**Fix:** Centralize your overtime tracking. Keep job and location info tied to each time entry. This is where a tool like [TimeCamp](/go/timecamp) can help by linking time tracking to jobs and payroll, so you don’t have to do the math manually.

### 3. Forgetting to Include Partial Hours or Rounding Errors

Rounding down hours or ignoring partial hours worked can add up to significant unpaid overtime. For example, if your crew’s time sheets round 7.75 hours down to 7, you lose 45 minutes per person per day. Over a week, that’s almost 4 hours per worker.

**Fix:** Set a clear policy on rounding (for example, nearest 6 minutes or quarter hour) and stick to it. Train foremen and office staff to check time sheets carefully before payroll.

### 4. Letting Foremen Handle Overtime Without Clear Guidelines

Foremen often manage time tracking on site but might not fully understand overtime rules or the cost impact. This can lead to inconsistent practices, like approving extra hours without documentation or missing overtime entirely.

**Fix:** Provide foremen with a simple overtime checklist and clear rules on what counts as overtime. Make them accountable for accurate time records and train them on the basics of overtime laws relevant to your crew.

## Understanding Overtime Pay Requirements for Small Construction Businesses

Overtime pay isn’t just about hitting 40 hours a week. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) says you must pay time-and-a-half for hours worked over 40 in a workweek. Some states add daily overtime rules, like paying overtime after 8 hours in a day. For small crews, this means you can’t just track weekly totals and call it done.

For example, if your crew works 9 hours Monday through Friday, that’s 45 hours total. The 5 extra hours are overtime. But if you’re in California, you owe overtime for every hour over 8 each day, so that’s 5 hours of daily overtime plus any over 40 weekly. You need to track both daily and weekly hours carefully.

Also, remember that certain time counts as hours worked under FLSA, including time spent traveling between job sites during the workday, mandatory meetings, and even some training. Missing these can mean unpaid overtime and penalties.

## What Counts as Overtime Hours for Small Crew Workers?

This question trips up many owners because not all time on the clock counts the same. Under FLSA, overtime includes all hours your crew is “suffered or permitted” to work. That means:

- Time spent on job tasks, including setup and cleanup  
- Travel between job sites during the workday (not commute to first job or from last job home)  
- Mandatory meetings, safety briefings, and training sessions  
- Waiting time if the crew is required to stay on site  

Unpaid breaks don’t count, but if you pay for breaks, that time must be included in hours worked. For example, if your crew takes a 15-minute paid break, that 15 minutes counts toward overtime calculations.

If you miss logging any of these, you risk underpaying overtime and facing penalties. Make sure your time tracking captures all compensable time, not just “on the clock” work.

## Can Small Construction Companies Pay Overtime Hourly or Salaried?

Yes, but it depends on how you classify your workers and how you set up payroll. Most small construction crews pay hourly and calculate overtime based on hours worked over the threshold. However, some owners pay salaried workers who are exempt from overtime, but this is tricky.

The FLSA has strict tests for exempt status, usually requiring a minimum salary and specific job duties. Most crew members who work hands-on jobs won’t qualify as exempt. Misclassifying workers as salaried exempt to avoid overtime can lead to costly fines and back pay.

If you want to pay salaried workers, make sure you consult a labor law expert and keep detailed records. For most small crews, hourly pay with clear overtime tracking is simpler and safer.

## How to Avoid Common Overtime Mistakes in Small Construction Companies

Here’s a quick reality check for your crew’s overtime tracking:

- **Track every minute your crew is on the clock**: This includes drive time, setup, cleanup, and mandatory breaks if they are paid.  
- **Know your state’s rules**: Some states require daily overtime, others don’t. If you work across state lines, you need to track by location.  
- **Use simple tools that tie time to jobs and locations**: This reduces errors and makes payroll smoother.  
- **Train your foremen and office staff** on what counts as overtime and how to log it properly.  
- **Review time sheets weekly** to catch mistakes before payroll.

## A Real Scenario: Roofing Crew Overtime Chaos Fixed

Take a 15-person roofing crew working multiple residential jobs in a metro area. Before, the foreman scribbled hours on a whiteboard at the end of the day. Drive time wasn’t tracked, and overtime was often guessed or ignored. Payroll was a scramble every week, with angry calls from workers about missing overtime pay.

After switching to a simple app that lets crew clock in/out by job and records drive time, the foreman got a checklist:

- Clock in at job site start  
- Clock out for breaks (mandatory)  
- Clock in/out for drive time between sites  
- Note any extra hours over 8 per day or 40 per week  

Payroll staff reviewed the app reports weekly, catching errors early. Overtime pay matched actual hours worked, workers were happier, and the owner saved thousands by avoiding overpayments and fines.

## Step-by-Step Checklist to Avoid Overtime Mistakes Next Week

1. **Define compensable time clearly** for your crew (include drive, setup, cleanup).  
2. **Train foremen on overtime basics** and their role in tracking hours accurately.  
3. **Use a simple time tracking method** that ties hours to jobs and locations (apps like TimeCamp help here).  
4. **Set and enforce a rounding policy** for hours worked.  
5. **Review time sheets weekly** to catch errors before payroll runs.  
6. **Communicate overtime rules clearly** to crew members so they know what to expect.  

## Common questions from owners

**What counts as overtime hours under FLSA for small crews?**  
Overtime under FLSA means any hours worked over 40 in a workweek. This includes all time spent on job tasks, travel between jobs during the day, mandatory meetings, and some training. Breaks that are unpaid don’t count. Make sure to track all compensable time to avoid missing overtime pay.

**Can small construction companies pay overtime hourly or salaried?**  
Most small crews pay hourly and calculate overtime based on hours worked. Paying salaried workers who are exempt from overtime is possible but risky. The FLSA requires a minimum salary and specific job duties for exempt status. Misclassifying crew members as salaried exempt can lead to fines and back pay. Hourly pay with clear overtime tracking is usually safer.

**Can small construction companies classify workers as independent contractors to avoid overtime?**  
Classifying workers as independent contractors can be tempting but is risky. The IRS and Department of Labor have strict tests based on control and work relationship. Misclassification can lead to back pay, penalties, and fines. If your crew is on your schedule, uses your tools, and works under your direction, they are likely employees and subject to overtime rules.

**What are the penalties for overtime violations in small construction companies?**  
Penalties can include back pay for unpaid overtime, fines from the Department of Labor, and even lawsuits. For example, if you underpay overtime by $1,000, you might owe double that in damages plus interest and legal fees. Keeping accurate records and paying overtime correctly protects you from costly penalties.

**How do I handle overtime when my crew works in multiple states?**  
You need to track hours by state because overtime rules vary. Some states have daily overtime, others don’t. Use a time tracking system that tags hours by job location to calculate overtime correctly. Our guide on [running construction payroll across multiple states](https://payrollforcrews.com/blog/multi-state-construction-payroll/) has more details.

**Is it worth switching from paper timesheets to a digital system for overtime tracking?**  
Absolutely. Paper timesheets and whiteboards lead to errors, lost time, and missed overtime. Digital tools reduce mistakes, speed up payroll, and give you real-time visibility into hours worked.

## Wrapping It Up

Overtime mistakes happen because small crews juggle many moving parts and paperwork often falls to the last minute. The key moves are to get your foremen responsible and trained, track all compensable time (especially drive and setup), and use a system that ties hours to specific jobs. Start with a simple checklist and clear communication this week. If you’re still using paper or whiteboards, try a basic app like TimeCamp to cut errors and save time.
