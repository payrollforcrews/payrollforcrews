If you run a small crew-based business, your week usually looks like this:

- Crews in the field  
- Invoices going out  
- Bills coming in  
- Bank accounts moving every day  

You know you should have clean books, but between payroll, bids, and putting out fires, accounting is the thing that gets handled later.

Tools like **Adam by Tyms** try to solve that by acting like an **AI accountant** that sits on top of your bank accounts and bookkeeping. Instead of you wrestling with spreadsheets or complex software, you connect your bank, upload statements, and let Adam categorize transactions, generate financials, and answer questions in plain English.

This page is not a hype page. It is here so you can decide if this is worth testing for your size of business, and what role it should play next to your payroll and time tracking tools.

## What Adam by Tyms actually does (in normal words)

Adam is built to do three main jobs for a small business:

1. **Ingest your money flow**  
   - Connect bank accounts, or upload bank statements  
   - Pull in transactions automatically  

2. **Clean and organize the data**  
   - Categorize income and expenses  
   - Keep a structured chart of accounts  
   - Maintain the ledgers and journals in the background  

3. **Spit out the numbers you or your accountant care about**  
   - Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, trial balance  
   - Dashboards that show how the business is doing  
   - Answers to questions like:  
     - “How much did we spend on fuel this month”  
     - “Which client or job has the highest margin”  

You talk to it like a person (web, WhatsApp, email), and it does the bookkeeping heavy lifting.

You can use Adam as:

- A standalone accounting system, or  
- An AI layer on top of tools like QuickBooks or Xero, where it syncs back and forth instead of forcing a full migration  

## Where it fits for crew-based businesses

For a typical 5–50 person crew business (construction, field services, cleaning, etc.), the stack usually looks like:

- **Time tracking and scheduling** → something like TimeCamp or Connecteam  
- **Payroll and HR** → something like WebHR or a payroll provider  
- **Accounting** → QuickBooks, Xero, or whatever you have hacked together  

Adam is trying to live in that third slot.

Good fits:

- You want **clean books and basic financial reports** without becoming your own bookkeeper  
- You often **fall behind on categorizing transactions** because you would rather be in the field or selling  
- You want to **ask questions about your numbers in normal language** instead of wrestling with reports  

Not a great fit:

- You already have an accountant and bookkeeper who are on top of things and you like the current workflow  
- You do heavy, custom job costing inside another system and do not want one more tool in the mix  
- You are allergic to anything AI flavored and just want classic accounting software  

## What about pricing

Pricing can move around, but as of late 2025, Adam’s own site shows:

- Starter style plans in the **low tens of dollars per month** for solo owners  
- Higher tiers for businesses that:  
  - Sync multiple US bank accounts  
  - Handle higher monthly transaction volume  
  - Want more capacity and integrations  

Tyms also has its own classic accounting plans that start at a few dollars per user per month, with full accounting features, if you would rather think in terms of users or branches than AI credits.

Bottom line: it is usually **cheaper than a full blown accounting department**, and roughly in line with other small business accounting tools, especially if you factor in time saved.

Always double check their live pricing page before you buy, because promo deals and tiers can change.

## Pros for a small crew owner

From the point of view of a small construction or field-service owner, the upside looks like this:

- **Less “I will do the books on Sunday” guilt.**  
  You can upload statements and let Adam categorize and post transactions.  

- **Faster visibility into whether jobs are paying off.**  
  When the books stay current, you see sooner if you are making money or just staying busy.  

- **Plain language answers.**  
  You do not have to know where the report lives. You can ask practical questions and let the tool do the digging.  

- **Works with existing tools.**  
  If you are already on QuickBooks or Xero, Adam can sync instead of forcing a hard switch.  

## Cons and things to watch

No tool is magic, and Adam has tradeoffs you should know about:

- **You still need to care a little.**  
  If nobody ever checks what the AI is doing, errors can sit in your books. It lightens the load, it does not remove ownership.  

- **Bank sync can still be imperfect at times.**  
  Like any modern fintech tool, you may occasionally need to upload statements manually.  

- **AI credits and usage limits.**  
  Some plans use a credit model for chats, transactions, and document uploads, so heavy users may need higher tiers.  

- **It is not built just for construction.**  
  You may need to work with your accountant to make sure job costing and your chart of accounts match how you think about jobs and crews.  

## How it plays with your payroll and time tracking

Adam lives on the accounting side, but the value shows up only if your payroll and time tracking stack is not a mess.

If you are still figuring out your base setup, start there:

- Read our guide on getting a stable setup: [Best payroll and time tracking setup for 10 to 50 person construction crews](/blog/construction-payroll-setup/)  
- If you mix W2s and 1099s, make sure you are not creating tax problems: [How to handle payroll when you have both W2 employees and 1099 contractors](/blog/w2-and-1099-payroll/)  

Once that part is stable, Adam can help you see whether those jobs are actually profitable, not just busy.

## When Adam makes sense in your stack

For a small crew business, think of Adam like this:

- If you **have no real accounting system**, and you are tired of being blind, Adam can be a first serious step  
- If you **do have QuickBooks or Xero but hate using it**, Adam can act as a friendlier front end  
- If you **already have a bookkeeper you trust**, Adam might still be useful as a helper for them, but talk to them first  

A simple way to test it:

1. Pick **one entity** (one LLC or one business)  
2. Connect or upload **one or two bank accounts**  
3. Run it for **a month or two** alongside your current process  
4. Ask very practical questions, for example:  
   - “What did fuel cost us this month versus last”  
   - “Which client had the healthiest margin this quarter”  
   - “Are we making any money after payroll and materials on Job X”  

If Adam helps you answer those without hours of hunting, it is earning its keep.

## How this link works

If you decide to try Adam by Tyms and you use this link:

[Start Adam by Tyms with my link](https://app.useadam.io/auth/register?linkId=lp_914554&sourceId=payrollforcrews&tenantId=tyms)

I may earn a commission if you stay on as a paying customer. It does not change your price, and it helps fund more deep dive guides like this.

If at some point I decide Adam is not a good fit for most small crew businesses, I will either:

- Update this page to say so, or  
- Swap this recommendation for another tool that fits better  

You should only sign up if you actually think an AI accounting assistant will save you more time and hassle than it costs.
