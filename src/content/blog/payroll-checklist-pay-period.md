If your payroll process feels like chaos every pay period, you’re not alone. Maybe your foremen forget to note drive time, hours get scribbled on scraps of paper, or you scramble to track down missing time sheets before payday. This checklist breaks down what you need to do every pay period to keep payroll smooth, accurate, and less stressful.

You’ll get a clear sequence of steps, practical tradeoffs, and a real-world example from a small roofing crew to show how this works on the ground. No fluff, just what you need to run payroll without headaches.

## What to Collect and Confirm Before You Run Payroll

Start by gathering all the raw data. For a crew of 12 roofers, this means:

- Time cards or digital time entries from foremen (including start/end times, breaks, and drive time)
- Records of any overtime or double-time hours
- Job codes or cost centers for each worker’s hours (to track job costing)
- Any bonuses, deductions, or advances to apply this period

**Tradeoff:** If you rely on paper time sheets, expect delays and errors. Digital time tracking tied to payroll (like TimeCamp) can cut down on chasing missing info and help you see job-level labor costs instantly. But it requires some upfront training and buy-in from your foremen.

## Who’s Responsible for What: Divide and Conquer

Assign clear roles:

- Foremen: Collect and verify crew hours daily, including travel and lunch breaks. They should submit time sheets or approve digital entries by the end of the last workday in the pay period.
- Office/Payroll Admin: Review submitted hours for accuracy, check for missing entries, and enter data into the payroll system.
- Owner/Manager: Double-check overtime calculations and final payroll summary before submission.

**Scenario:** On a roofing crew, foremen often forget to record drive time between sites. By making this a daily checklist item for foremen, you avoid underpaying or having to fix payroll later.

## Check for Common Errors Before Approving Payroll

Before you hit “process,” run through this quick checklist:

- Confirm all crew members have submitted hours.
- Verify overtime rules are applied correctly (e.g., after 40 hours/week or double time on holidays).
- Check that job codes match the right projects.
- Make sure any deductions (like equipment rental or advances) are documented and authorized.
- Ensure new hires or terminated employees are updated in the payroll system.

Missing one of these can cause payroll corrections that waste time and frustrate your crew.

## How to Handle Job Costing and Payroll Together

Tracking labor cost by job is crucial for small crews to bid better and spot unprofitable projects. Make sure your time tracking method captures job codes or tasks alongside hours.

For example, a landscaping crew of 15 might track hours separately for mowing, planting, and irrigation work. This helps you see which tasks eat up labor and adjust pricing or crew assignments accordingly.

If you’re still using spreadsheets, consider switching to a tool that ties time tracking directly to payroll and job costing, like TimeCamp. It saves double entry and reduces errors.

## Fixing the Pay Period Workflow: A Roofing Crew Example

A 10-person roofing crew was losing hours on paper time sheets. Foremen collected hours weekly but forgot to include drive time and didn’t always record overtime correctly. Payroll took two days to process, and paychecks were often delayed or inaccurate.

After switching to daily digital time tracking with job codes and making foremen responsible for daily submission, the crew owner saw these improvements:

- Payroll prep time dropped from 2 days to half a day.
- Overtime was caught and paid correctly every time.
- Drive time was tracked and paid without chasing foremen.
- Job costing reports showed which roof types were most labor-intensive.

This change took some training but paid off quickly in fewer payroll headaches and happier crews.

## Certified Payroll Checklist Tips for Construction Crews on Public Jobs

If you’re working on public or prevailing wage jobs, certified payroll adds another layer of complexity. Here’s a quick checklist to keep certified payroll clean and compliant:

- Collect certified payroll reports from your payroll provider or software that include worker classifications and wage rates.
- Verify that wage rates meet or exceed prevailing wage requirements for each job classification.
- Confirm fringe benefits are accounted for correctly (cash or bona fide benefits).
- Keep daily logs of hours worked per job and classification, signed by foremen or supervisors.
- Submit certified payroll reports on time according to contract or government deadlines.
- Retain all payroll records and certified reports for at least three years.

Missing certified payroll details can lead to contract penalties or payment delays. If you’re new to certified payroll, check out our guide to [Certified Payroll Basics for Small Contractors](https://payrollforcrews.com/blog/certified-payroll-basics/) for a deeper dive.

## Construction Payroll Compliance Checklist: Avoid Costly Mistakes

Compliance isn’t just about following rules. It’s about avoiding fines, delays, and headaches that come from missed details. Here’s a quick compliance checklist to run through every pay period:

- Confirm worker classifications are correct (employee vs contractor, apprentice vs journeyman).
- Check that wage rates and overtime calculations meet federal, state, and local laws.
- Verify that all required taxes (federal, state, local) are withheld and reported.
- Make sure certified payroll reports (if applicable) are complete and submitted on time.
- Document and authorize any deductions or advances.
- Keep accurate records of all payroll transactions for at least three years.
- Stay updated on changes in labor laws or prevailing wage rates in your area.

Failing compliance checks can result in penalties or contract holdbacks. If you want to dig deeper into compliance for your crew size, see our [Best Payroll and Time Tracking Setup for 10 to 50 Person Construction Crews](https://payrollforcrews.com/blog/construction-payroll-setup/).

## Do Construction Workers Qualify for Overtime Pay?

Yes, most construction workers do qualify for overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and state laws. Here’s what you need to watch for:

- Overtime usually kicks in after 40 hours worked in a workweek.
- Some states have daily overtime rules (e.g., overtime after 8 hours in a day).
- Double time may apply on holidays or for hours beyond a certain threshold.
- Exemptions exist but are rare for field crew workers.

**Example:** If a crew member works 45 hours in a week, the first 40 are at regular pay, and 5 hours should be paid at 1.5 times the regular rate. Missing this can cause payroll errors and upset your crew.

Make sure your foremen track hours daily and verify overtime before payroll runs. For common pitfalls, check out our article on [The Most Common Overtime Mistakes Small Crew-Based Businesses Make](https://payrollforcrews.com/blog/overtime-mistakes-small-crews/).

## Why Is Certified Payroll Important for Construction Jobs?

Certified payroll is a must-have when you’re working on public or prevailing wage jobs. It’s a detailed report that confirms you’re paying the correct wages and benefits as required by law.

Here’s why it matters:

- It keeps you compliant with government contracts.
- Prevents payment delays or penalties from agencies.
- Provides transparency and proof that workers are paid fairly.
- Helps you avoid costly audits or contract disputes.

If you’re new to certified payroll, don’t wait until the first report is due. Set up your process early, train your foremen on daily time tracking and classifications, and use software that can generate certified payroll reports easily.

## How to Track Hours and Job Costs for Field Crews Without Losing Your Mind

Accurate job costing starts with good time tracking habits. Here’s a simple approach to keep it manageable:

1. Use job codes or task categories on every time entry (e.g., “Site prep,” “Electrical,” “Cleanup”).
2. Have foremen verify time and job codes daily, not weekly.
3. Use a mobile-friendly time tracking app so crews can clock in/out and select jobs on the spot.
4. Review job costing reports weekly to catch errors early.
5. Tie your time tracking data directly into payroll to avoid double entry and mistakes.

For crews still on paper, moving to a digital system like TimeCamp can save hours each pay period and improve job cost visibility. This helps you spot which jobs or tasks are bleeding labor dollars before it’s too late.
