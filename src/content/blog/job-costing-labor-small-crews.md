If you run a small crew, say 8 to 15 people on a roofing or landscaping job, you know how fast labor costs can slip through the cracks. Maybe your foreman forgets to log drive time, or hours get scribbled on scraps of paper that vanish by payroll day. Without clear job-level labor costing, you’re flying blind on profitability.

This post cuts to the chase on how to see your labor cost by job even with a small crew. You’ll get a practical checklist, real-world tradeoffs, and a simple crew workflow that actually works on the ground. No fluff, just what you need to start tracking and controlling labor costs next week.

## Why Job Costing Labor Matters for Small Crews

When your crew is small, every hour counts. If you don’t know which jobs are bleeding labor dollars, you can’t price or schedule properly. For example, a 10-person concrete crew might spend an extra hour driving between sites daily, but if that time isn’t tracked by job, it looks like productive work. That adds up to thousands lost each month.

Job costing labor lets you:

- Spot jobs that run long or require overtime
- Adjust bids based on real crew performance
- Hold foremen accountable for accurate time tracking
- Improve scheduling and reduce downtime

## What Usually Goes Wrong on Small Crews

Here’s a typical scenario: You have a 12-person landscaping crew working two sites. The foreman writes hours on a whiteboard at the truck. Drive time and breaks get lumped in or forgotten. Payroll day, you scramble to piece together who worked where and when. The result: you guess labor cost by job, often underestimating it.

The problem is lack of clear responsibility and a simple system. When foremen aren’t accountable for detailed time tracking, or when you rely on memory and paper, errors multiply.

## How to Actually Track Labor Cost by Job with a Small Crew

### Step 1: Assign Foremen Responsibility for Daily Job-Level Time Logs

Make your foremen responsible for recording start and stop times for each crew member on each job. This includes:

- Actual work hours on the job
- Drive time between jobs or to supply runs
- Breaks and downtime

Use a simple time tracking sheet or app on a phone or tablet. If you prefer paper, use a standardized form with columns for name, job code, start/end times, and notes.

### Step 2: Keep Time Tracking Centralized and Consistent

Collect all daily logs at the end of the day or week in one place. This can be a shared folder, a single spreadsheet, or a time tracking app. Consistency is key. If you use paper, scan or photograph sheets daily to avoid lost data.

### Step 3: Calculate Labor Cost by Job Weekly

Once you have hours by job, multiply by each worker’s hourly rate (including taxes and benefits). Add any overtime premiums. This gives you a clear labor cost per job for the week.

### Step 4: Review and Adjust

Hold a quick weekly meeting with your foremen to review labor costs by job. Discuss any surprises like unexpected drive time or overtime. Use this info to adjust scheduling, bids, or crew assignments.

## How to Accurately Allocate Labor Costs Across Multiple Jobs for Small Construction Crews

When your crew splits time between multiple jobs in a day, accurate allocation is crucial. For example, if a crew member spends 3 hours on Job A, then drives 30 minutes to Job B and works 4 hours there, you need to track those hours separately.

Here’s a simple approach:

- Break the day into chunks by job and non-job activities (drive, breaks)
- Have your foreman or crew member record start and stop times for each chunk
- Use job codes or names consistently to avoid confusion
- Track drive time separately but assign it to the job it supports (e.g., driving to Job B counts as Job B’s labor cost)

If you’re using paper forms, a column for job code and a notes section help clarify mixed days. Apps that let crew members clock in and out by job make this easier and reduce errors.

## How to Track Employee Time for Job Costing on Small Crews

Tracking time on small crews doesn’t have to be complicated. The biggest challenge is keeping it simple enough that foremen actually do it every day.

Here’s what works:

- Use a single sheet or app per day per foreman
- Include columns for crew member name, job code, start time, end time, and notes (for drive time, breaks)
- Train foremen to collect this info at the end of each job segment or when moving between sites
- Review the logs daily or weekly to catch missing entries early

If your crew is tech-savvy, a time tracking app like TimeCamp can simplify this by letting crew clock in/out by job on their phones. It ties directly to payroll and billing, cutting down on data entry headaches.

## How to Calculate Labor Cost Per Job with Limited Payroll Data

If your payroll system doesn’t break down hours by job, you can still get close with manual calculations:

- Gather total hours worked per employee for the week
- Use your daily job-level time logs to estimate hours per job
- Multiply job hours by the employee’s fully loaded hourly rate (wages + taxes + benefits)
- Add overtime premiums where applicable

For example, if Joe worked 40 hours total, and your logs show 25 hours on Job A and 15 on Job B, apply his hourly cost accordingly. This gives you a rough but actionable labor cost per job.

If you want to tighten this up, consider moving to a time tracking system that integrates with payroll to reduce manual work and errors.

## What Is Job Costing Labor in a Small Construction Company?

Job costing labor means tracking exactly how much labor time and cost goes into each job your crew works on. It’s not just total hours worked, but breaking those hours down by job, including drive time, breaks, and overtime. For small crews, this level of detail helps you see which jobs are profitable and which ones are draining your labor budget.

Think of it like this: if your crew spends 40 hours in a week but 6 of those are driving between jobs or waiting on materials, you want to know which job those hours belong to. Without this, your job cost reports will be off, and you might underbid or lose money without realizing it.

## Can QuickBooks Track Labor Costs by Job for Small Construction Companies?

QuickBooks can track labor costs by job if you set it up right, but it’s not always straightforward for small crews. You need to use QuickBooks’ time tracking features or integrate with a time tracking app that feeds job-level hours into QuickBooks.

The challenge is getting your crew’s time data into QuickBooks accurately. If you’re still relying on paper timesheets or inconsistent logs, QuickBooks won’t magically fix that. It works best when paired with a solid time tracking system that assigns hours to jobs before syncing.

If you’re considering QuickBooks, think about whether you want to add a time tracking app or use QuickBooks Time (formerly TSheets). Otherwise, manual entry can be a headache and prone to errors.

## Real Example: Small Roofing Crew Gets Control Over Labor Costs

A 9-person roofing crew was struggling with unpredictable labor costs. Foremen tracked hours on paper but didn’t separate drive time or breaks. The owner switched to a simple app that let foremen clock in and out by job on their phones. Drive time was tracked separately.

Within two weeks, they saw that drive time was eating up 15% of billable hours. They reorganized jobs geographically and scheduled supply runs more efficiently. Labor costs dropped 8% in the first month, and bids became more accurate.

If you want to try something like this, TimeCamp is a solid choice for small crews needing job-costed time tracking tied to payroll and billing.

## Checklist: What to Do This Week to Start Job Costing Labor

- Decide who will be responsible for daily job-level time tracking (usually foremen)
- Choose your tracking method: paper form, spreadsheet, or simple app
- Create or download a standardized time tracking sheet with columns for job, start/end times, and notes
- Train your foremen on what to track (work hours, drive time, breaks)
- Set a routine to collect and review time logs weekly
- Calculate labor cost by job using hourly rates and hours tracked
- Hold a weekly review meeting to discuss labor cost insights and adjustments

## Common questions from owners

**What percentage of total job cost is typically labor for small crews?**  
Labor usually makes up 30% to 50% of total job cost, depending on the trade and job complexity. For crews like roofing or landscaping, expect closer to 40%. Knowing this helps you spot when labor is unusually high and needs attention.

**How often should small construction crews update labor cost tracking?**  
Weekly updates work best for small crews. Daily tracking is ideal but reviewing and calculating labor cost weekly keeps it manageable and timely for adjusting bids and schedules.

**What are common mistakes small construction companies make in job costing labor?**  
The biggest mistakes are lumping drive time into productive hours, relying on memory or informal notes, and failing to assign clear responsibility for time tracking. These lead to underestimating labor costs and inaccurate bids.

**How can I track employee time for job costing without fancy software?**  
Use a simple paper form or spreadsheet with columns for job code, start/end times, and notes. Make sure your foremen understand the importance and check the logs regularly to catch errors early.

**Can I calculate labor cost per job if my payroll data isn’t detailed?**  
Yes, by combining total hours from payroll with your daily job-level time logs, you can allocate hours to jobs manually. Multiply those hours by fully loaded hourly rates to estimate labor cost per job.

**Can QuickBooks track labor costs by job for small construction companies?**  
Yes, but only if you set it up properly with time tracking features or integrate it with a time tracking app. QuickBooks alone won’t solve inaccurate or incomplete time data. For small crews, pairing QuickBooks with a simple app or consistent manual logs is key to accurate job costing.

## Wrapping Up

Small crews don’t need complicated systems to get a grip on labor costs by job. The key moves are clear responsibility, simple consistent tracking, and weekly review. Start with a straightforward time log your foremen can manage without hassle. Then use that data to spot waste and improve bids.

If you’re still juggling receipts and messy records, an AI accountant like Adam from Tyms can help keep your numbers straight without hiring extra staff.

Next step: Pick your tracking method and get your foremen logging job-level hours this week. You’ll quickly see where your labor dollars go and gain control over your crew’s profitability.
