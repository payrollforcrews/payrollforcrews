Running payroll for a construction crew is not the same as paying five office staff on salary.

You have people bouncing between jobsites, a mix of W2 and 1099, rain delays, overtime, and probably some paper time sheets that live in a truck door.

This guide is for owners and project managers with roughly 10 to 50 people on the books who want a simple, boring setup that works every pay period.

## The problems that keep biting small crews

Most small construction companies start in one of these modes:

- Manual spreadsheets and paper time sheets.
- A basic payroll service with no real time tracking.
- QuickBooks plus a stack of texts from foremen.

That leads to:

- Missed hours or padded hours because time tracking is sloppy.
- Extra admin time every pay period to clean up messy data.
- Risky guessing on overtime, job costing, and taxes.

You do not need a giant ERP system to fix this. You just need each part of the stack to do its job.

## The core stack for construction crews

You can think about your setup in three layers:

1. Time tracking at the jobsite.  
2. Payroll that can handle W2, 1099, and multiple states.  
3. Accounting that keeps everything clean for tax time.

Here is a simple pattern that fits a lot of small construction companies.

### 1. Time tracking and job costing

You need something that makes it easy for crew members and foremen to clock in and out by job, not just by day.

Tools like [TimeCamp](/go/timecamp) and [Connecteam](/go/connecteam) are worth a serious look for this.

You want:

- Mobile app that works even with weak signal.
- Job or project codes so hours tie back to real work.
- GPS or geofencing so you can confirm people are on site.
- Simple reports you can export into payroll.

If a tool makes it hard for your least tech friendly worker to clock in, it will fail. Look for big buttons, clear labels, and as few steps as possible.

### 2. Payroll that can handle your mix of workers

Once you have clean time data, you need payroll that can:

- Pay W2 employees and 1099 subcontractors.
- Handle multiple states if your crews cross borders.
- Deal with overtime rules without constant manual editing.

Systems like [WebHR](/go/webhr) and [Lano](/go/lano) are built for more complex mixes of workers, including global hires in Lano’s case.

For a 10 to 50 person construction company, focus on:

- How easy it is to import time data from your tracking tool.
- How clearly it shows taxes, deductions, and net pay.
- Whether support is used to hearing from small contractors, not just office managers.

If the vendor does not have a straight answer about multi state crews, keep moving.

### 3. Accounting that matches your reality

On the accounting side you want something that keeps invoices, bills, and payroll aligned without a lot of manual re typing.

Modern tools like [Tyms](/go/tyms) aim to automate a lot of the grunt work. You can also run more traditional tools as long as they can sync with your payroll and bank feeds.

The key is:

- Job costing. You want to see labor cost by project, not just in a giant lump.
- Clean separation between materials, subs, and crew payroll.
- Simple reporting for your tax preparer or accountant.

If your current setup makes you rebuild job cost reports by hand in a spreadsheet, that is a sign the accounting tool is not supporting you.

## How to roll this out without chaos

Here is a simple sequence that many owners can follow in about thirty days.

1. **Pick your time tracking tool first.**  
   Test it with one or two crews for a week. Have foremen send you screenshots of their screens and ask what confuses them.

2. **Connect it to your payroll system.**  
   Start with a test run where you do not actually submit payroll. Check totals against your old method.

3. **Run one pay period with both systems.**  
   Yes, it is extra work for a short time. It lets you catch mistakes before they hit real checks.

4. **Turn off the old method.**  
   Once you are confident, stop accepting paper time sheets and side texts. One system only.

5. **Clean up the accounting side.**  
   After a month of clean payroll, sit down with whoever handles your books and wire job codes and categories so labor cost shows up in the right place.

## When you should not switch yet

If you are behind on taxes, missing basic records, or in the middle of a big contract dispute, it may be smarter to stabilize first.

In that case:

- Tighten up your current process for two or three pay periods.
- Document how hours are collected and who signs off.
- Fix obvious gaps like missing time sheets or unclear overtime rules.

Use that as the baseline for any new tools you try.

Switching while things are on fire just gives you two fires.
