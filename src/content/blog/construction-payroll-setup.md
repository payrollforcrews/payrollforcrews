Running payroll for a construction crew is not the same as paying five office staff on salary.

You have people bouncing between jobsites, a mix of W2 and 1099, rain delays, overtime, and probably some paper time sheets that live in a truck door.

This guide is for owners and project managers with roughly 10 to 50 people on the books who want a simple, boring setup that works every pay period.

## The problems that keep biting small crews

Most small construction companies start in one of these modes:

- Manual spreadsheets and paper time sheets.
- A basic payroll service with no real time tracking.
- QuickBooks plus a stack of texts from foremen.

That leads to:

- Missed hours or padded hours because time tracking is sloppy.
- Extra admin time every pay period to clean up messy data.
- Risky guessing on overtime, job costing, and taxes.

You do not need a giant ERP system to fix this. You just need each part of the stack to do its job.

## The core stack for construction crews

You can think about your setup in three layers:

1. Time tracking at the jobsite.  
2. Payroll that can handle W2, 1099, and multiple states.  
3. Accounting that keeps everything clean for tax time.

Here is a simple pattern that fits a lot of small construction companies.

### 1. Time tracking and job costing

You need something that makes it easy for crew members and foremen to clock in and out by job, not just by day.

Tools like [TimeCamp](/go/timecamp) and [Connecteam](/go/connecteam) are worth a serious look for this.

You want:

- Mobile app that works even with weak signal.
- Job or project codes so hours tie back to real work.
- GPS or geofencing so you can confirm people are on site.
- Simple reports you can export into payroll.

If a tool makes it hard for your least tech friendly worker to clock in, it will fail. Look for big buttons, clear labels, and as few steps as possible.

### 2. Payroll that can handle your mix of workers

Once you have clean time data, you need payroll that can:

- Pay W2 employees and 1099 subcontractors.
- Handle multiple states if your crews cross borders.
- Deal with overtime rules without constant manual editing.

Systems like [WebHR](/go/webhr) and [Lano](/go/lano) are built for more complex mixes of workers, including global hires in Lano’s case.

For a 10 to 50 person construction company, focus on:

- How easy it is to import time data from your tracking tool.
- How clearly it shows taxes, deductions, and net pay.
- Whether support is used to hearing from small contractors, not just office managers.

If the vendor does not have a straight answer about multi state crews, keep moving.

### 3. Accounting that matches your reality

On the accounting side you want something that keeps invoices, bills, and payroll aligned without a lot of manual re typing.

Modern tools like [Tyms](/go/tyms) aim to automate a lot of the grunt work. You can also run more traditional tools as long as they can sync with your payroll and bank feeds.

The key is:

- Job costing. You want to see labor cost by project, not just in a giant lump.
- Clean separation between materials, subs, and crew payroll.
- Simple reporting for your tax preparer or accountant.

If your current setup makes you rebuild job cost reports by hand in a spreadsheet, that is a sign the accounting tool is not supporting you.

## How to roll this out without chaos

Here is a simple sequence that many owners can follow in about thirty days.

1. **Pick your time tracking tool first.**  
   Test it with one or two crews for a week. Have foremen send you screenshots of their screens and ask what confuses them.

2. **Connect it to your payroll system.**  
   Start with a test run where you do not actually submit payroll. Check totals against your old method.

3. **Run one pay period with both systems.**  
   Yes, it is extra work for a short time. It lets you catch mistakes before they hit real checks.

4. **Turn off the old method.**  
   Once you are confident, stop accepting paper time sheets and side texts. One system only.

5. **Clean up the accounting side.**  
   After a month of clean payroll, sit down with whoever handles your books and wire job codes and categories so labor cost shows up in the right place.

## When you should not switch yet

If you are behind on taxes, missing basic records, or in the middle of a big contract dispute, it may be smarter to stabilize first.

In that case:

- Tighten up your current process for two or three pay periods.
- Document how hours are collected and who signs off.
- Fix obvious gaps like missing time sheets or unclear overtime rules.

Use that as the baseline for any new tools you try.

Switching while things are on fire just gives you two fires.

## Best ways to track time for construction crews under 50

For crews of this size, time tracking needs to be straightforward and reliable. Your crew members are often on the move, so a mobile-friendly app that works offline is key. GPS or geofencing features help confirm workers are on site, reducing buddy punching or missed punches.

Consider these practical points:

- Foremen should be able to quickly see who clocked in or out without digging through menus.
- Crew members should be able to switch jobs easily if they move between sites in a day.
- If your crew uses paper timesheets now, start by digitizing just one crew’s time to test the process.

Simple daily check-ins via app or text can replace the old paper stack and reduce errors. The goal is to get accurate hours tied to the right job with minimal hassle.

## What payroll software works best for small construction crews?

The best payroll software for small crews handles your mix of W2 employees and 1099 subcontractors, supports multiple states if needed, and integrates smoothly with your time tracking system.

Look for these features:

- Easy import of time data from your chosen tracking tool.
- Clear breakdown of taxes, deductions, and net pay for each worker.
- Support teams familiar with construction crews, not just office payroll.

## How to set up construction payroll for small crews without headaches

Setting up payroll for a small crew means balancing accuracy with simplicity. Start by picking tools that fit your crew’s size and work style. Test each part separately before connecting them.

Key steps:

- Choose a time tracking tool that your crew can actually use.
- Pick payroll software that matches your worker mix and state rules.
- Make sure accounting tools can handle job costing without extra manual work.

## Common questions from owners

### How often should I run payroll for a small construction crew?

Most small crews run payroll every two weeks or monthly. Biweekly pay periods help keep workers happy and make overtime calculations more straightforward. Monthly can work if your crew is stable and you have good time tracking.

### Can I integrate time tracking with payroll for my construction crew?

Yes. The best setups let you export or sync time data directly into payroll. This reduces errors and saves admin time. Make sure your time tracking tool and payroll system support compatible file formats or direct integrations.

### How do I calculate payroll taxes for construction crews?

Payroll taxes depend on worker type, location, and pay frequency. W2 employees have Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes withheld. 1099 contractors handle their own taxes, but you still report payments. Payroll software usually automates these calculations based on worker classification and state rules.

### Is it worth switching payroll providers if I only have a small crew?

Yes, if your current system forces you to fix hours every pay period or makes multi-jobsite reporting painful, a switch can save you real time and reduce errors. You do not need enterprise software, just a setup that fits how your crews actually work.

### Do I need a different payroll system for W2 employees and 1099 subcontractors?

No. The key is using tools that clearly distinguish between employees and contractors and handle them with the right tax rules. Your time tracking and payroll system should store worker type per person and keep contractor payments out of your W2 runs.
