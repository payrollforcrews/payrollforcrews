A lot of small construction, trades, and field-service companies grow up with a mix of people:

- A core crew of W2 employees.
- A handful of 1099 subcontractors you bring in on certain jobs.
- Maybe a part-time office person somewhere in the middle.

On paper, this sounds simple. In real life it turns into a mess of different forms, pay rhythms, and “who gets what” questions.

This guide is not legal advice or tax advice. It is a practical way to think about paying both groups cleanly using tools that understand the difference.

## W2 vs 1099 in plain language

Very roughly:

- **W2 employees** are on your payroll. You withhold taxes, pay employer taxes, and handle things like overtime and benefits.
- **1099 contractors** invoice you. You do not withhold their taxes, but you may need to report what you paid them at the end of the year.

The line between the two is defined by law and by how the work is actually controlled. If you are not sure whether someone should be W2 or 1099, talk to an accountant or employment lawyer in your state.

For our purposes here, we will assume you already have a mix and want to run payroll in a way that does not confuse them.

## The problems when you treat them the same

Common issues when you mix W2 and 1099 in a sloppy way:

- Contractors get added into payroll as if they were employees.
- Employees get asked to invoice like subcontractors.
- Time tracking does not clearly separate who is which type.
- Reports for taxes and job costing are hard to untangle.

You do not need a separate system for each group, but you do need your tools to understand the difference.

## What to look for in your tools

When you evaluate payroll and HR systems like [WebHR](/go/webhr) or [Lano](/go/lano), and time tracking tools like [TimeCamp](/go/timecamp) or [Connecteam](/go/connecteam), check that they can:

- Store each person with the right worker type (employee vs contractor).
- Apply the right tax handling for each group.
- Tag time entries to the right person and job.
- Produce clean reports showing:
  - Wages paid to employees.
  - Amounts paid to contractors.
  - Labor cost by job that includes both.

If a system treats everyone as “just a payee” without distinction, it will create work for you at year end.

## A simple weekly rhythm that works

Here is one pattern that fits a lot of 10–50 person crews.

### 1. Track all hours in one place

Use one time tracking tool for everyone, but:

- Mark each person as “employee” or “contractor” in the system.
- Make sure each time entry is attached to a job or cost code.
- Train foremen to approve time for their crews at the end of each day or week.

When you run reports, filter by worker type if you need to see them separately.

### 2. Run payroll for W2 employees on a fixed schedule

Pick a simple rhythm:

- Weekly for some field crews.
- Every two weeks for others.

Run W2 payroll through your payroll system on that rhythm and ignore contractor invoices for the moment. Focus on:

- Correct hours.
- Overtime rules for your state.
- Deductions and benefits.

### 3. Pay 1099 contractors off approved time or invoices

For contractors, decide how you want to handle approvals:

- Option 1: They submit invoices that reference job codes and dates.
- Option 2: You pay them based on approved time in your tracking system.

In both cases:

- Tag the payments clearly as contractor expenses in your accounting tool (something like [Tyms](/go/tyms) or whatever you use).
- Keep them out of the W2 payroll run so taxes do not get withheld incorrectly.

### 4. Reconcile in accounting once per period

At least once a month:

- Pull a report of labor cost (employees + contractors) by job.
- Compare that to what you know about progress and billing.
- Make sure your accounting system mirrors reality:
  - Wages → payroll expense.
  - Contractor payments → subcontractor or contractor expense.

If your time tracking and payroll tools can both export to your accounting tool cleanly, this reconciliation is much faster.

## Common pitfalls with mixed crews

A few things to watch out for:

- Moving someone from 1099 to W2 (or the other way) and forgetting to update every system.
- Paying a contractor through payroll “just this once” and creating confusion for both taxes and records.
- Not updating worker type when someone’s role changes.
- Letting each foreman invent their own way of tracking who is W2 and who is 1099.

The fix is usually boring: one source of truth for worker type, one time tracking system, and clear setup in payroll and accounting.

## When to get outside help

If you are:

- Expanding into new states.
- Taking on public work with certified payroll requirements.
- Unsure whether certain workers should be W2 or 1099.

…then it is worth paying a professional for an hour or two of advice. Once you know the right classification, you can set up your systems to follow it without constant second guessing.

You do not need enterprise HR software to handle a mixed crew. You just need tools that know the difference between employees and contractors, and a weekly rhythm you can stick to even on busy jobs.
