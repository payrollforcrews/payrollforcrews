A lot of small construction, trades, and field-service companies grow up with a mix of people:

- A core crew of W2 employees.
- A handful of 1099 subcontractors you bring in on certain jobs.
- Maybe a part-time office person somewhere in the middle.

On paper, this sounds simple. In real life it turns into a mess of different forms, pay rhythms, and “who gets what” questions.

This guide is not legal advice or tax advice. It is a practical way to think about paying both groups cleanly using tools that understand the difference.

## W2 vs 1099 in plain language

Very roughly:

- **W2 employees** are on your payroll. You withhold taxes, pay employer taxes, and handle things like overtime and benefits.
- **1099 contractors** invoice you. You do not withhold their taxes, but you may need to report what you paid them at the end of the year.

The line between the two is defined by law and by how the work is actually controlled. If you are not sure whether someone should be W2 or 1099, talk to an accountant or employment lawyer in your state.

For our purposes here, we will assume you already have a mix and want to run payroll in a way that does not confuse them.

## The problems when you treat them the same

Common issues when you mix W2 and 1099 in a sloppy way:

- Contractors get added into payroll as if they were employees.
- Employees get asked to invoice like subcontractors.
- Time tracking does not clearly separate who is which type.
- Reports for taxes and job costing are hard to untangle.

You do not need a separate system for each group, but you do need your tools to understand the difference.

## What to look for in your tools

When you evaluate payroll and HR systems like [WebHR](/go/webhr) or [Lano](/go/lano), and time tracking tools like [TimeCamp](/go/timecamp) or [Connecteam](/go/connecteam), check that they can:

- Store each person with the right worker type (employee vs contractor).
- Apply the right tax handling for each group.
- Tag time entries to the right person and job.
- Produce clean reports showing:
  - Wages paid to employees.
  - Amounts paid to contractors.
  - Labor cost by job that includes both.

If a system treats everyone as “just a payee” without distinction, it will create work for you at year end.

## A simple weekly rhythm that works

Here is one pattern that fits a lot of 10–50 person crews.

### 1. Track all hours in one place

Use one time tracking tool for everyone, but:

- Mark each person as “employee” or “contractor” in the system.
- Make sure each time entry is attached to a job or cost code.
- Train foremen to approve time for their crews at the end of each day or week.

When you run reports, filter by worker type if you need to see them separately.

### 2. Run payroll for W2 employees on a fixed schedule

Pick a simple rhythm:

- Weekly for some field crews.
- Every two weeks for others.

Run W2 payroll through your payroll system on that rhythm and ignore contractor invoices for the moment. Focus on:

- Correct hours.
- Overtime rules for your state.
- Deductions and benefits.

### 3. Pay 1099 contractors off approved time or invoices

For contractors, decide how you want to handle approvals:

- Option 1: They submit invoices that reference job codes and dates.
- Option 2: You pay them based on approved time in your tracking system.

In both cases:

- Tag the payments clearly as contractor expenses in your accounting tool (something like [Tyms](/go/tyms) or whatever you use).
- Keep them out of the W2 payroll run so taxes do not get withheld incorrectly.

### 4. Reconcile in accounting once per period

At least once a month:

- Pull a report of labor cost (employees + contractors) by job.
- Compare that to what you know about progress and billing.
- Make sure your accounting system mirrors reality:
  - Wages → payroll expense.
  - Contractor payments → subcontractor or contractor expense.

If your time tracking and payroll tools can both export to your accounting tool cleanly, this reconciliation is much faster.

## How to classify workers correctly as W2 or 1099

Getting worker classification right is crucial to avoid headaches and penalties. The key question is control: who controls how, when, and where the work is done?

- **W2 employees** usually work under your direction, follow your schedule, and use your tools.
- **1099 contractors** run their own business, decide how to do the job, and may work for multiple clients.

For example, if you have a carpenter who comes to your site daily, uses your equipment, and follows your schedule, they are likely a W2 employee. But if you hire a specialized subcontractor who sets their own hours and brings their own tools, they are probably a 1099 contractor.

If you are unsure, consult a professional. Misclassification can lead to back taxes and fines.

## Managing payroll compliance for mixed W2 and 1099 crews on job sites

Compliance means following tax laws and labor rules for each worker type. For W2 employees, you must withhold income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare, and pay unemployment taxes. You also need to follow overtime and wage laws.

For 1099 contractors, you do not withhold taxes. Instead, you report payments over $600 on Form 1099-NEC at year end. Contractors handle their own taxes.

On busy jobsites, keep these points in mind:

- Do not pay contractors through your payroll system to avoid withholding mistakes.
- Keep clear records of hours, job codes, and payments for both groups.
- Use systems that separate worker types and automate tax forms.

This reduces your risk and keeps your accounting clean.

## How to manage payroll for W2 and 1099 workers on job sites

On the jobsite, your focus is on getting crews paid accurately and on time. Here is a practical approach:

- Use one time tracking system that tags workers as employees or contractors.
- Have foremen approve time daily or weekly to catch errors early.
- Run payroll for W2 employees on a regular schedule, applying overtime and deductions.
- Pay contractors separately based on approved time or invoices.
- Keep all payments tied to jobs for accurate job costing.

This approach keeps your crews happy and your books in order. For more on setting up payroll and time tracking for crews, see [Best Payroll and Time Tracking Setup for 10 to 50 Person Construction Crews](https://payrollforcrews.com/blog/construction-payroll-setup/).

## Common pitfalls with mixed crews

A few things to watch out for:

- Moving someone from 1099 to W2 (or the other way) and forgetting to update every system.
- Paying a contractor through payroll “just this once” and creating confusion for both taxes and records.
- Not updating worker type when someone’s role changes.
- Letting each foreman invent their own way of tracking who is W2 and who is 1099.

The fix is usually boring: one source of truth for worker type, one time tracking system, and clear setup in payroll and accounting.

## When to get outside help

If you are:

- Expanding into new states.
- Taking on public work with certified payroll requirements.
- Unsure whether certain workers should be W2 or 1099.

…then it is worth paying a professional for an hour or two of advice. Once you know the right classification, you can set up your systems to follow it without constant second guessing.

You do not need enterprise HR software to handle a mixed crew. You just need tools that know the difference between employees and contractors, and a weekly rhythm you can stick to even on busy jobs.

## Managing payroll for W2 and 1099 workers on job sites effectively

Managing payroll for a crew with both W2 employees and 1099 contractors can feel complicated on busy job sites. The key is to keep things simple and organized.

Start by using one time tracking system that clearly marks each worker as either an employee or a contractor. This helps avoid confusion when paying and reporting. Have foremen review and approve time daily or weekly to catch mistakes early.

Run payroll for your W2 employees on a consistent schedule, making sure to apply overtime rules and handle tax withholdings properly. For 1099 contractors, pay them separately based on either approved time entries or invoices. Keep these payments out of your payroll system to avoid withholding errors.

Finally, tie all payments back to jobs for accurate job costing and easier accounting. This straightforward approach reduces mistakes and keeps your crews paid on time.

## Tips for correctly classifying workers as W2 or 1099

Correct classification of your workers is critical to avoid penalties and tax problems. The main factor is control: who decides how, when, and where the work gets done?

W2 employees generally work under your direction, follow your schedule, and use your tools and equipment. Contractors usually run their own business, set their own hours, and bring their own tools.

For example, a laborer who shows up every day, uses your equipment, and follows your schedule is likely a W2 employee. A subcontractor who sets their own hours and works for multiple clients is probably a 1099 contractor.

If you are unsure about a worker’s classification, get advice from an accountant or employment lawyer. Correct classification upfront saves headaches later.

## Handling payroll compliance for mixed W2 and 1099 crews

Compliance means following tax and labor laws for each worker type. For W2 employees, you must withhold income taxes, Social Security, Medicare, and pay unemployment taxes. You also need to follow state overtime and wage laws.

For 1099 contractors, you do not withhold taxes. Instead, you report payments over $600 on Form 1099-NEC at the end of the year. Contractors are responsible for their own taxes.

On job sites, avoid paying contractors through your payroll system to prevent withholding mistakes. Keep clear records of hours worked, job codes, and payments for both employees and contractors. Use software that separates worker types and automates tax form generation to reduce risk and keep your accounting clean.

## Managing payroll for W2 and 1099 workers on job sites: Why a clear process matters

On busy job sites, juggling payroll for both employees and contractors can get messy fast. A clear process that fits your crew’s daily work helps prevent mistakes and saves time.

For example, if your foremen approve time daily, you catch errors before payroll runs. Paying contractors separately keeps taxes straight and avoids surprises. Linking all payments back to jobs means your job costing stays accurate, which helps with billing and profitability.

This kind of simple, consistent routine is what keeps crews paid on time and owners sane.

## Common questions from owners

**Do I need to withhold taxes for 1099 contractors?**  
No. You do not withhold income or payroll taxes for 1099 contractors. They handle their own tax payments. You only need to report payments over $600 at year end using Form 1099-NEC.

**What forms do I need to file for W2 employees and 1099 contractors?**  
For W2 employees, you file Forms W-2 and W-3 with the IRS and provide W-2s to your employees. For 1099 contractors, you file Form 1099-NEC to report payments over $600 and send copies to the contractors.

**Can 1099 contractors receive benefits like W2 employees?**  
Generally, no. Benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off are usually only for W2 employees. Offering benefits to contractors can blur classification lines and cause compliance problems.

**Can I pay a worker as both W2 and 1099 in the same year?**  
It is possible but tricky. If a worker’s role changes during the year, update their classification in all systems promptly. Mixing payment types without clear records can cause tax and compliance issues. Consult a professional if this situation arises.

**What happens if I pay a contractor through payroll by mistake?**  
Paying a contractor through payroll can cause incorrect tax withholding and reporting. Fix it quickly by separating payments and consulting your accountant. Avoid doing this repeatedly to prevent penalties.
