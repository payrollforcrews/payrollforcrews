Most owners switch payroll systems only when they are already frustrated.

Maybe support went downhill, fees crept up, or your current provider cannot handle the way your crews really work. The problem is that switching in the middle of the year feels risky, so a lot of people just put up with a bad setup for another twelve months.

You do not have to wait for January. You just need a clean plan.

This guide walks through a simple, low-drama way to switch providers mid-year for a 5 to 50 person crew-based business.

## When it actually makes sense to switch mid-year

A mid-year switch is worth it when:

- Your current system keeps causing payroll errors or missed hours.
- You are spending hours every pay period fixing time data or tax settings.
- You are adding new locations or states and your current provider cannot keep up.
- You are not getting the reports you need for job costing or your accountant.

If your biggest issues are past-due taxes or missing returns, deal with those first with your current provider or an accountant. A switch will not fix old compliance problems by itself.

## What your new provider must be able to do

Before you even think about dates, you want a short list of must-haves for the new system.

For most small construction, trades, and field service companies, that list looks like:

- Easy import of time from your tracking system (not manual typing).
- Support for both W2 employees and 1099 subcontractors.
- Multi-state support if crews cross state lines.
- Clear handling of overtime rules for your states.
- Decent support that will actually answer questions during the switch.

When you are evaluating vendors like [WebHR](/go/webhr) or [Lano](/go/lano), ask them directly:

> “Have you helped a 10–50 person construction or field-service company switch mid-year before? What went wrong and how did you fix it?”

If they cannot give a real-world answer, that is a red flag.

## The data you need from your current provider

A clean switch depends on pulling the right history out of your current system. At minimum, export:

- Year-to-date payroll reports for all employees and contractors.
- A list of active and inactive employees with addresses and tax details.
- Any custom earnings, deductions, or benefits codes you use.
- Tax filings or summaries done so far this year.

Most providers have standard reports for this. If you are not sure which ones you need, ask support:

> “I am planning to switch payroll providers mid-year. Which reports should I export to capture year-to-date wages, taxes, and contributions?”

Save these exports in a folder and back them up. You may never look at some of them again, but you will be glad you have them if there’s a question later.

## A simple timeline for a low-drama switch

Here is a basic four-week pattern that works for many small crews.

### Week 1 – Decide and prep

- Pick your new provider and sign up.
- Export the data listed above from your current system.
- Give the new provider access to those files.
- Ask them to build a dummy run of payroll based on your last pay period.

### Week 2 – Test run

- Keep paying people through your old system for one more period.
- In parallel, run a full test payroll in the new system.
- Compare totals:
  - Gross pay
  - Taxes
  - Deductions
  - Net pay

If anything is off, fix it now while the old system is still live.

### Week 3 – First live run on the new system

- Tell your crews that the pay stub format might change but pay dates will not.
- Turn off any “automatic” runs in the old system so you do not double pay.
- Run your first real payroll in the new system.
- Spot check a few employees’ pay against expectations.

### Week 4 – Clean up and confirm

- Make sure your new provider has registered for any state tax accounts they need.
- Confirm future tax filings will be handled correctly (who files what, and when).
- Archive access to your old system and store your exports safely.

After this, the new system becomes the source of truth.

## How to talk to your crew about the change

Most people just care that:

- They are paid on time.
- The amount looks right.
- They know who to ask if there’s an issue.

A simple message is enough:

> “We are switching payroll systems so that time from the field flows in cleaner and we spend less time chasing down hours. Pay dates will not change. Your net pay should not change. If anything looks off on the first run, tell us and we will fix it quickly.”

Then back that up by being reachable for the first pay period or two and correcting small mistakes fast.

## Common mistakes to avoid

A few things to watch out for:

- Turning off the old system before you have exported your year-to-date history.
- Forgetting to handle benefit deductions or garnishments in the new setup.
- Running two live payrolls in the same period because “auto run” was still turned on.
- Assuming the new system will “just know” your overtime rules.

If you and your new provider follow a clear export → test → live pattern, a mid-year switch does not have to be painful. In many cases, it is the only way to stop wasting time every pay period on a system that outgrew your crews years ago.
