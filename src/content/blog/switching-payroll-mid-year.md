Most owners switch payroll systems only when they are already frustrated.

Maybe support went downhill, fees crept up, or your current provider cannot handle the way your crews really work. The problem is that switching in the middle of the year feels risky, so a lot of people just put up with a bad setup for another twelve months.

You do not have to wait for January. You just need a clean plan.

This guide walks through a simple, low-drama way to switch providers mid-year for a 5 to 50 person crew-based business.

## When it actually makes sense to switch mid-year

A mid-year switch is worth it when:

- Your current system keeps causing payroll errors or missed hours.
- You are spending hours every pay period fixing time data or tax settings.
- You are adding new locations or states and your current provider cannot keep up.
- You are not getting the reports you need for job costing or your accountant.

If your biggest issues are past-due taxes or missing returns, deal with those first with your current provider or an accountant. A switch will not fix old compliance problems by itself.

## What your new provider must be able to do

Before you even think about dates, you want a short list of must-haves for the new system.

For most small construction, trades, and field service companies, that list looks like:

- Easy import of time from your tracking system (not manual typing).
- Support for both W2 employees and 1099 subcontractors.
- Multi-state support if crews cross state lines.
- Clear handling of overtime rules for your states.
- Decent support that will actually answer questions during the switch.

When you are evaluating vendors like [WebHR](/go/webhr) or [Lano](/go/lano), ask them directly:

> “Have you helped a 10–50 person construction or field-service company switch mid-year before? What went wrong and how did you fix it?”

If they cannot give a real-world answer, that is a red flag.

## The data you need from your current provider

A clean switch depends on pulling the right history out of your current system. At minimum, export:

- Year-to-date payroll reports for all employees and contractors.
- A list of active and inactive employees with addresses and tax details.
- Any custom earnings, deductions, or benefits codes you use.
- Tax filings or summaries done so far this year.

Most providers have standard reports for this. If you are not sure which ones you need, ask support:

> “I am planning to switch payroll providers mid-year. Which reports should I export to capture year-to-date wages, taxes, and contributions?”

Save these exports in a folder and back them up. You may never look at some of them again, but you will be glad you have them if there’s a question later.

## A simple timeline for a low-drama switch

Here is a basic four-week pattern that works for many small crews.

### Week 1 – Decide and prep

- Pick your new provider and sign up.
- Export the data listed above from your current system.
- Give the new provider access to those files.
- Ask them to build a dummy run of payroll based on your last pay period.

### Week 2 – Test run

- Keep paying people through your old system for one more period.
- In parallel, run a full test payroll in the new system.
- Compare totals:
  - Gross pay
  - Taxes
  - Deductions
  - Net pay

If anything is off, fix it now while the old system is still live.

### Week 3 – First live run on the new system

- Tell your crews that the pay stub format might change but pay dates will not.
- Turn off any “automatic” runs in the old system so you do not double pay.
- Run your first real payroll in the new system.
- Spot check a few employees’ pay against expectations.

### Week 4 – Clean up and confirm

- Make sure your new provider has registered for any state tax accounts they need.
- Confirm future tax filings will be handled correctly (who files what, and when).
- Archive access to your old system and store your exports safely.

After this, the new system becomes the source of truth.

## How to talk to your crew about the change

Most people just care that:

- They are paid on time.
- The amount looks right.
- They know who to ask if there’s an issue.

A simple message is enough:

> “We are switching payroll systems so that time from the field flows in cleaner and we spend less time chasing down hours. Pay dates will not change. Your net pay should not change. If anything looks off on the first run, tell us and we will fix it quickly.”

Then back that up by being reachable for the first pay period or two and correcting small mistakes fast.

## How to avoid payroll mistakes when switching providers

Switching payroll providers mid-year can cause mistakes if you rush or miss details. For example, if your crew works overtime regularly, make sure the new system applies your state’s overtime rules correctly from day one. A common crew scenario is a foreman who notices paychecks are lower because overtime wasn’t calculated right. Catch this during your test run.

Also, double-check that all deductions, like health benefits or wage garnishments, transfer properly. If your old provider had custom codes, confirm your new system supports them or find equivalent options.

Finally, keep your old payroll system active until you confirm the new one runs smoothly. This avoids double payments or missed paychecks, which can frustrate your crew and slow down your jobsite.

## Steps to transfer employee payroll data mid-year

Transferring payroll data mid-year is mostly about getting the right reports and importing them cleanly. Start by exporting year-to-date wages, tax withholdings, and any contributions for every employee and contractor. Include inactive workers if you might pay them again this year.

Next, provide your new payroll provider with this data so they can set up accurate tax filings and avoid duplicate payments. For crews working across states, confirm multi-state tax data is included.

If your crew has both W2 employees and 1099 subcontractors, make sure you separate their data clearly. You can find more details in our guide on [handling payroll for W2 employees and 1099 contractors](https://payrollforcrews.com/blog/w2-and-1099-payroll/).

## Common questions from owners

### Can I switch payroll providers without disrupting crew pay?

Yes. The key is to keep running payroll on your old system while testing the new one. Only switch fully once you confirm the new system calculates pay correctly and all data is accurate. Communicate clearly with your crew so they know pay dates and amounts won’t change.

### What happens to tax filings when I switch payroll providers mid-year?

Your new provider needs your year-to-date tax filings and wage reports to handle future filings correctly. They will continue submitting taxes for the rest of the year, but you must make sure all prior filings are accounted for. Keep copies of all tax documents from your old provider in case of questions.

### What should I do if my payroll provider changes mid-year and I notice errors?

Report errors immediately to your new provider and keep your old system accessible until issues are resolved. Common errors include incorrect tax withholdings or missing overtime pay. Fixing these quickly protects your crew and keeps your business compliant.

### How do I transfer employee payroll data mid-year without mistakes?

Export all year-to-date payroll reports, including wages, taxes, and deductions. Share these with your new provider and run test payrolls to catch any discrepancies. Confirm that all employee details, including addresses and tax info, are up to date.

### What are the biggest mistakes to avoid when switching payroll providers mid-year?

Avoid turning off your old system before exporting all necessary data. Don’t assume the new system will automatically apply your overtime or deduction rules. Also, watch out for running two payrolls in the same period by accident. Following a clear export, test, and live run process helps prevent these issues.
