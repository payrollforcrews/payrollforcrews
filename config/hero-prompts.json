    "prompt": "Ultra realistic IMAX-level cinematic photograph. Shot on a modern digital cinema camera with wide, immersive framing and rich dynamic range. Natural, believable lighting in real-world conditions, with honest shadows and contrast, whether cloudy daylight, harsh afternoon sun, or early evening. A small blue collar crew, mostly men in their 20s to 50s, captured mid-shift or at the end of the day. Clothing clearly shows hard work: scuffed boots, worn work pants, sweat marks, dust, mud, and grime on fabric and hands. The environment is gritty and lived-in with tools, materials, cords, pallets, mud or dust on the ground, coffee cups and small clutter, nothing polished or staged. People are caught mid-task or mid-conversation, not looking at the camera, with real, hard-working expressions.  A crew owner in worn work pants and a faded flannel shirt sits at a cramped corner desk inside a small shop office. The desk is piled with receipts, notebooks, and bank statements, with a plain laptop open beside them. The owner leans over the papers, hands dusty and tired, thinking through the numbers. The walls are imperfect, with taped notes and a few tools or gear hanging nearby, clearly part of a working crew space, not a polished corporate office.",

Their hands and clothes show dust, grime, and wear. Around them are tools, pallets, and a partially built structure, giving the sense of employees and subcontractors sorting out work and pay together.",
